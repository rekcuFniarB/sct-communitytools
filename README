cronjob to run once a day (or similar)

configure CACHE_BACKEND django setting & co.

There are currently two examples - a very simplistic 'simpleproject' in the
examples/ directory (see examples/simpleproject/README) and a more
sophisticated example called CommunityDraft which i recommend as using as a base for your
own projects (if you start from scratch).
